NLTK

When exporting news about a certain topic a lot of trash is incorporated. Traditionally finding the trash meant
either manually looking through each article or using boolean search methods. Using boolean restricts how many
articles comes in. I would like to use machine learning to swift through all the trash and take out only relevant
articles.

Once relevant articles are exported, I would like to take out interesting words and graph that throught time.
